# Exploring Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Objective
In this assignment, we use the [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle to perform K-Means clustering. The goal is to segment customers based on age, annual income, and spending score, gaining insights into customer behavior through effective data visualization. Additionally, we will optimize the clustering model for better performance.

## Tasks

1. **Dataset Overview:**
   - Briefly describe the chosen dataset, highlighting key features.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots.
   - Visualize feature distributions and potential correlations.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and normalize relevant features.

4. **K-Means Clustering:**
   - Apply K-Means clustering with different values of K.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using suitable metrics.

5. **Model Optimization:**
   - Explore techniques for optimizing the K-Means clustering model.
   - Consider adjusting hyperparameters, such as the initialization method or convergence criteria.
   - Evaluate the impact of optimizations on clustering results.

6. **Visualizing Clusters:**
   - Create effective visualizations, such as scatter plots and 3D scatter plots, to showcase cluster separation.

7. **Cluster Analysis:**
   - Interpret cluster characteristics, focusing on age, income, and spending behavior.

8. **Insights and Conclusion:**
   - Summarize key insights from customer segmentation.
   - Discuss potential marketing or business strategies based on identified customer segments.
