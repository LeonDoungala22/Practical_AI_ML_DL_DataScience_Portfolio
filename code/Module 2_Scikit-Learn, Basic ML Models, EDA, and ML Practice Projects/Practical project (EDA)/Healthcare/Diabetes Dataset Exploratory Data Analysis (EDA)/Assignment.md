### 5. Statistical Analysis
   - **Hypothesis Testing**
      - Formulate hypotheses related to healthcare outcomes or features.
      - Conduct hypothesis testing using appropriate statistical tests.
      - Interpret the results and discuss their implications.
   - **Population Inferences**
      - Use statistical tests to make inferences about the broader population based on the sample data.

### 6. Probability Analysis
   - **Calculate Probabilities**
      - Calculate probabilities related to healthcare outcomes given different conditions.
      - Interpret the probabilities in the context of the dataset.
   - **Conditional Probabilities**
      - Explore conditional probabilities and assess their significance.
      - Identify any surprising or noteworthy findings.

### 7. Correlation Analysis
   - **Compute Correlations**
      - Calculate and visualize correlations between healthcare variables.
      - Identify strong correlations and discuss their potential implications.
   - **Significance of Relationships**
      - Discuss the significance of significant correlation coefficients.
      - Explore potential causal relationships between variables.

### 8. Data Exploration
   - **Univariate Analysis**
      - Conduct univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual healthcare variables.
      - Identify any outliers or unusual patterns.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**
      - Explore relationships between pairs of healthcare variables through bivariate analysis.
      - Use statistical measures and visualizations to support your observations.
   - **Insights**
