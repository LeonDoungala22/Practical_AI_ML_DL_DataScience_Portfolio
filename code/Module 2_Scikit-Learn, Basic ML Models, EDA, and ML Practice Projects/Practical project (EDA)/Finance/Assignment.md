# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Finance and Banking Prediction

## Dataset
Explore the [Finance and Banking Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriricky/finance-banking-predication?select=credit_train.csv) from Kaggle to gain insights into finance and banking-related predictions.

## Objective
Conduct EDA to understand patterns and factors influencing the finance and banking prediction processes.

## Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Display the first few rows to understand the structure.

### 2. Data Cleaning
   - Check for missing values and outliers.
   - Ensure data consistency and correctness.

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
   - Calculate basic descriptive statistics for key financial variables.
   - Explore the central tendency and dispersion of features.

### 4. Correlation Analysis
   - Visualize correlations between different financial features.
   - Identify significant relationships between variables.

### 5. Variable Relationships
   - Perform bivariate analysis to understand relationships between financial variables.
   - Use scatter plots and pair plots for visual exploration.

### 6. Data Distribution
   - Visualize the distribution of key financial variables using histograms or kernel density plots.
   - Stratify the data based on different conditions or prediction outcomes.

### 7. Summary and Insights
   - Summarize key findings from the EDA.
   - Provide insights into potential factors influencing finance and banking predictions.
