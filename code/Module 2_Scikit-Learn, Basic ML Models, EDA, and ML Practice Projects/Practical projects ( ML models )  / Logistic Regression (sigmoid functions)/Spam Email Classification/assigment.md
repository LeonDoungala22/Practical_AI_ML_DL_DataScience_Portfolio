# Logistic Regression for Spam Email Classification

## Objective

Build a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

## Dataset

Download the "Spam or Ham" dataset from Kaggle: [Spam or Ham Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

## Tasks

1. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle.
   - Explore the dataset structure.

2. **Preprocess Text Data:**
   - Perform necessary text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, etc.

3. **Split Data:**
   - Divide the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Vectorize Text Data:**
   - Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize the text data.

5. **Implement Logistic Regression:**
   - Use the scikit-learn library to implement logistic regression.

6. **Train the Model:**
   - Train the logistic regression model on the training set.

7. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Assess the model's performance on the testing set.

8. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Analyze the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

9. **Fine-tune the Model:**
   - Explore opportunities for fine-tuning the model and improving performance if necessary.

## Notes

- Adjust file paths accordingly when loading the dataset.
- Document your code with comments for clarity.
- Consider visualizing key results or insights.
