# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective
Build and interpret a linear regression model to predict salaries.

## Dataset
[Salary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression?resource=download)

## Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration
   - Load and analyze the dataset.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Explore statistical summary.

### 2. Data Visualization
   - Create visualizations (scatter plots, histograms) for Salary and features.
   - Visualize the correlation matrix.

### 3. Linear Regression Model
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Implement simple linear regression.
   - Evaluate model performance (MSE, R-squared).

### 4. Model Interpretation
   a. **Interpret Coefficients:**
      - Explain coefficient meanings.
      - Discuss the impact of feature changes on predicted salaries.

   b. **Feature Significance:**
      - Discuss feature significance.
      - Identify impactful features.

   c. **Regression Line Visualization:**
      - Include scatter plot with regression line.
      - Comment on alignment with data points.

   d. **Model Limitations:**
      - Address model limitations and assumptions.

### 5. Submission
   - Include detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations in your report.
   - Relate findings back to the problem of predicting salaries.
