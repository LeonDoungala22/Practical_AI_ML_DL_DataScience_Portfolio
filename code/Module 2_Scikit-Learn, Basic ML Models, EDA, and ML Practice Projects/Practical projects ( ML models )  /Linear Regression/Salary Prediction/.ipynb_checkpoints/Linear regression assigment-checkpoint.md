# Assignment: Salary Prediction using Linear Regression Analysis

## Objective:
The primary goal of this assignment is to build, evaluate, and interpret a linear regression model to predict salaries based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset:
[Salary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression?resource=download)

## Tasks:

### 1. Data Exploration:
   a. Load the dataset and perform basic exploratory data analysis.
   b. Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   c. Explore the statistical summary of the dataset.

### 2. Data Visualization:
   a. Create visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, box plots) to understand the distribution of the target variable (Salary) and key features.
   b. Visualize the correlation matrix to identify potential relationships between features.

### 3. Linear Regression Model:
   a. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   b. Implement a simple linear regression model using a relevant feature(s) to predict salaries.
   c. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
   d. Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot.

### 4. Model Interpretation:
   a. **Interpret the Coefficients:**
      - Explain the meaning of the coefficients in the context of the linear regression model. Specifically, discuss how each unit change in the chosen feature(s) relates to the change in the predicted salary.
      - Highlight whether each coefficient is positive or negative and what that implies for the feature's impact on salary predictions.

   b. **Feature Significance:**
      - Discuss the significance of the chosen feature(s) in predicting salaries.
      - Identify which feature(s) have the most substantial impact on the model predictions and explain why.

   c. **Visualization of Regression Line:**
      - Include a visualization of the regression line on a scatter plot. This will provide a clear representation of how well the model fits the data.
      - Comment on how closely the regression line aligns with the data points and whether there are any patterns or trends.

   d. **Model Limitations:**
      - Address any limitations or assumptions made by the linear regression model. For example, discuss whether the relationship between the chosen feature(s) and salary is truly linear and if there are potential non-linearities not captured by the model.

### 5. Submission:
   Include detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations in your report or Jupyter notebook. Ensure clarity in your interpretations and relate them back to the problem of predicting salaries. This section is crucial for understanding the practical implications of the linear regression model and its utility in the given context.
