# Breast Cancer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning assignment focused on breast cancer classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The assignment utilizes the widely-used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available on Kaggle.

### Dataset
- **Dataset:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- **Objective:** Predict whether a breast mass is malignant or benign based on features extracted from fine needle aspirate (FNA) digitized images.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load and explore the dataset structure.
- Handle missing values.
- Explore the distribution of classes in the target variable ('diagnosis').

### 2. Data Visualization
- Create visualizations to understand feature distributions.
- Use violin plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.
- Plot a bar chart to display the distribution of classes in the target variable ('diagnosis').

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- Standardize the features if necessary.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors Model
- Implement the KNN algorithm using scikit-learn.
- Experiment with different values of k.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 5. Model Visualization
- Visualize decision boundaries of the KNN classifier.
- Plot a confusion matrix to understand the model's performance.

### 6. Conclusion
- Summarize results and discuss strengths and limitations of the KNN algorithm.
- Provide insights into the features influencing breast cancer diagnosis.
