# PCA Portfolio Project: Human Resources Analytics

## Introduction
Explore patterns and reduce dimensionality in the Human Resources Analytics dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Dataset
[Human Resources Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics) on Kaggle, containing data related to employee turnover and features such as satisfaction level, average monthly hours, and more.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
- Understand the structure of HR analytics data.
- Identify key features related to employee turnover.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean data, handle missing values.
- Explore relationships between features.

### 3. PCA Implementation
- Apply PCA to explore patterns in employee-related features.
- Determine an appropriate number of principal components.

### 5. Visualization
- Visualize the dataset before and after PCA.
- Use scatter plots or other suitable visualizations.
- Utilize the k-means algorithm to partition data into distinct clusters.

### 6. Correlation Circle
- Add a Correlation Circle to visually represent the relationships between variables.
- Interpret the Correlation Circle to understand the relationships and contributions of variables in the reduced-dimensional space.

### 7. Cluster Visualization
- Implement cluster visualization to identify patterns and groupings within the dataset.
- Discuss the insights gained from cluster visualization.

### 8. Analysis and Interpretation
- Analyze the results in terms of dimensionality reduction, visualization, Correlation Circle, and cluster visualization.
- Interpret principal components, correlations, and cluster patterns.
- Discuss implications for employee-related factors.

### 9. Documentation
- Provide well-structured documentation of the entire PCA process.
- Include insights gained from the analysis, focusing on both visualizations and statistical results.

## Conclusion
Summarize key findings, potential applications for HR analytics, and insights into employee turnover patterns. Emphasize the value of PCA and visualizations in understanding complex relationships within the dataset.
