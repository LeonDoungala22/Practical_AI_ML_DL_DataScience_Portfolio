#Bird stats

"""
The number of birds banded at a series of sampling sites has been counted by your field crew and
entered into the following list. The first item in each sublist is an alphanumeric code for the site and
the second value is the number of birds banded.

data = [['A1', 28], ['A2', 32], ['A3', 1], ['A4', 0], ['A5', 10], ['A6', 22], ['A7', 30], ['A8',
19], ['B1', 145], ['B2', 27], ['B3', 36], ['B4', 25], ['B5', 9], ['B6', 38], ['B7', 21], ['B8',
12], ['C1', 122], ['C2', 87], ['C3', 36], ['C4', 3], ['D1', 0], ['D2', 5], ['D3', 55], ['D4',
62],['D5', 98], ['D6', 32]]


        Write a script to answer these questions:
        - How many sites are there?
        - How many birds were counted at the 7th site?
        - How many birds were counted at the last site?
        - What is the total number of birds counted across all sites?
        - What is the average number of birds seen on a site?
        - What is the total number of birds counted on sites with codes beginning with C? (donâ€™t just
        identify these sites by eye, in the real world there could be hundreds or thousands of sites)
