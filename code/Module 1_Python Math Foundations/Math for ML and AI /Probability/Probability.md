## Introduction
Probability theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics that plays a pivotal role in machine learning. It enables us to quantify uncertainty, make predictions, and model complex systems. This documentation provides a deep dive into the basic probability concepts, probability distributions, and their significance in machine learning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Basic Probability Concepts
- **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Event (A):** A subset of the sample space representing a specific outcome or outcomes.
- **Probability of an Event (P(A)):** The likelihood of event A occurring.
- **Complement of an Event (A'):** The set of outcomes not in event A.
- **Intersection (A ∩ B) and Union (A ∪ B) of Events:** Outcomes common to both events and outcomes of either event.
- **Conditional Probability (P(A | B)):** Probability of event A given event B has occurred.
- **Addition Rule:**

## Probability Distributions

### Uniform Distribution
- **Explanation:** All outcomes in the sample space are equally likely.
- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** 
  ![Uniform PDF](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(x)&space;=&space;\frac{1}{b&space;-&space;a}&space;\text{for}&space;a&space;\leq&space;x&space;\leq&space;b)
- **Examples:** Rolling a fair six-sided die, where each face has a 1/6 probability.

#### Practical Example
- *Problem:* Find the probability of rolling a 3 or 4 on a fair six-sided die.
- *Solution:* 
  - Sample Space (S): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  - Event A: Rolling a 3 or 4 (A = {3, 4})
  - Probability P(A): P(3) + P(4) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

### Binomial Distribution
- **Explanation:** Models the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** 
  ![Binomial PMF](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(X&space;=&space;k)&space;=&space;{n&space;\choose&space;k}&space;p^k&space;(1-p)^{n-k})
- **Examples:** Tossing a coin (success: heads, failure: tails) multiple times, finding the probability of getting exactly k heads in n tosses.

#### Practical Example
- *Problem:* Calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses when the probability of heads is 0.5.
- *Solution:* 
  - n (number of trials) = 5, k (number of successful outcomes) = 3, p (probability of success) = 0.5
  - Using the Binomial PMF: 
  ![Binomial PMF Example](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(X&space;=&space;3)&space;=&space;{5&space;\choose&space;3}&space;(0.5)^3&space;(1-0.5)^2&space;=&space;10&space;\cdot&space;0.125&space;\cdot&space;0.25&space;=&space;0.3125)

### Poisson Distribution
- **Explanation:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** 
  ![Poisson PMF](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(X&space;=&space;k)&space;=&space;\frac{\lambda^k&space;e^{-\lambda}}{k!})
- **Examples:** Counting the number of emails received in an hour, with a known average email arrival rate λ.

#### Practical Example
- *Problem:* Find the probability of receiving exactly 2 emails in an hour when the average email arrival rate is 3 emails per hour.
- *Solution:* 
  - λ (average rate) = 3, k (number of events) = 2
  - Using the Poisson PMF:

### Normal Distribution
- **Explanation:** A continuous distribution with a bell-shaped curve. Widely used due to the Central Limit Theorem.
- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** 
  ![Normal PDF](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(x)&space;=&space;\frac{1}{\sigma&space;\sqrt{2\pi}}&space;e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}})
- **Examples:** Measuring the heights of individuals in a population, with heights closely following a normal distribution.

#### Practical Example
- *Problem:* Calculate the probability that a randomly selected individual's height is between 170 cm and 180 cm. The population mean (μ) is 175 cm, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 5 cm.
- *Solution:* 
  - Using the Normal Distribution PDF: 
  ![Normal PDF Example](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(170&space;\leq&space;X&space;\leq&space;180)&space;=&space;\int_{170}^{180}\frac{1}{5\sqrt{2\pi}}&space;e^{-\frac{(x-175)^2}{2\cdot&space;5^2}}&space;dx)

- **Examples:** Modeling the time between customer arrivals at a store or the lifespan of a lightbulb.

#### Practical Example
- *Problem:* Calculate the probability that a customer arrives within 5 minutes of opening the store, given that customers arrive at a rate of 0.2 customers per minute (λ = 0.2).
- *Solution:* 
  - Using the Exponential Distribution PDF: 
  ![Exponential PDF Example](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(X&space;\leq&space;5)&space;=&space;\int_{0}^{5}0.2&space;e^{-0.2x}dx)

## Central Limit Theorem
- **Explanation:** The sum or average of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of those variables.

## Practical Examples
1. **Coin Toss Example:** Simulate a large number of coin tosses and demonstrate how the Central Limit Theorem applies. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of sample means.

2. **Customer Arrival Example:** Calculate the probability of a certain number of customers arriving in a given time frame using the Poisson distribution.

3. **Height Measurement Example:** Calculate the probability of an individual's height falling within a certain range using the normal distribution.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding probability and probability distributions is crucial for EDA. It allows data scientists to:
- Assess data variability and identify outliers using the concept of z-scores.
- Identify patterns and trends by visualizing data distributions.
- Make informed decisions on data transformations and feature engineering based on the distribution of variables.
