# Ensemble Learning Focus Assignment: "Diabetes Prediction and Characterization"

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive analysis of the [Heart Disease UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and conduct an initial exploration.
 Database using ensemble learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking. The assignment aims to predict and characterize diabetes, including the inclusion of diabetes types.

## 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Load the [Heart Disease UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and conduct an initial exploration.
- Address missing values, outliers, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Utilize EDA visualizations to gain insights into key features.

## 2. Feature Engineering:
- Select relevant features based on the dataset analysis.
- Explore feature importance and consider creating new features to enhance ensemble model performance.
- **Add a new column: Diabetes_Type**
  - Based on domain knowledge, create a new column that categorizes the type of diabetes when the diagnosis is positive. Consider categorizing into types such as Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational Diabetes.

## 3. Ensemble Model Implementation:
- Implement ensemble models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train and tune each ensemble model using appropriate hyperparameter tuning.

## 4. Model Evaluation and Comparison:
- Evaluate ensemble models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize and compare feature importance across ensemble models.
- Analyze and compare the strengths and weaknesses of each ensemble technique.

## 5. Best Model Selection:
- Identify the best-performing ensemble model based on evaluation metrics.
- Provide reasoning for selecting the chosen model.

## 6. Data Visualization Techniques:
- Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing feature importance, model performance, and ensemble technique comparisons.

## 7. Characterization, Prediction, and Classification:
- Characterize diabetes by identifying key features contributing to the condition.
- Predict the likelihood of diabetes occurrence using the best-performing ensemble model.
- Classify instances into diabetic and non-diabetic categories.
- **Extend the classification:** Predict and visualize different diabetes types.

### Data Visualizations:
1. **Feature Importance Plot:**
   - Visualize the importance of features in predicting diabetes using a bar chart.

2. **Prediction Probability Distribution:**
   - Plot the distribution of predicted probabilities for diabetes occurrence, providing insights into the model's confidence levels.

3. **Classification Results Visualization:**
   - Create a confusion matrix or ROC curve to illustrate the classification performance for diabetic and non-diabetic instances.

## 8. Documentation:
- Establish a GitHub repository with a focus on ensemble learning for 4 databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach 
- Create a README file detailing the purpose, the dataset used, instructions for replicating the ensemble analysis, and information on the selected best model.
