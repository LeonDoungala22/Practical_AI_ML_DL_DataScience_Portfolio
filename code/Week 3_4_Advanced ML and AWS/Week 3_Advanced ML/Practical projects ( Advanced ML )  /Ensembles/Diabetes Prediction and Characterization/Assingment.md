# Ensemble Learning Focus Assignment: "Diabetes Prediction and Characterization with Diabetes Classification Dataset"

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive analysis of the Diabetes Classification Dataset using ensemble learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking. The assignment aims to predict and characterize diabetes, including the inclusion of disease types.

## 1. Data Exploration :
- Load the [Diabetes Classification Dataset](https://data.world/informatics-edu/diabetes-prediction/workspace/file?filename=Diabetes_Classification.xlsx) and conduct an initial exploration.
- Address missing values, outliers, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Utilize EDA visualizations to gain insights into key features.

## 2. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:
- Select relevant features based on the dataset analysis.
- Explore feature importance and consider creating new features to enhance ensemble model performance.
- Preprocessing 

## 3. Ensemble Model Implementation:
- Implement ensemble models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train and tune each ensemble model using appropriate hyperparameter tuning.

## 4. Model Evaluation and Comparison:
- Evaluate ensemble models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize and compare feature importance across ensemble models.
- Analyze and compare the strengths and weaknesses of each ensemble technique.

## 5. Best Model Selection:
- Identify the best-performing ensemble model based on evaluation metrics.
- Provide reasoning for selecting the chosen model.

## 6. Data Visualization Techniques:
- Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing feature importance, model performance, and ensemble technique comparisons.

## 7. Characterization, Prediction, and Classification:
- Characterize diabetes by identifying key features contributing to the condition.
- Apply PCA clustering to identify inherent patterns in the diabetes diagnosis data.
- Investigate if the PCA components reveal distinct clusters.
- Explore the possibility of automatically categorizing diabetes types (e.g., Type 1, Type 2) based on the identified patterns.
- Predict the likelihood of diabetes occurrence using the best-performing ensemble model.
- Classify instances into disease and non-disease categories.
- **Extend the classification:** Predict and visualize different diabetes types.

### Data Visualizations:
1. **Feature Importance Plot:**
   - Visualize the importance of features in predicting diabetes using a bar chart.

2. **Prediction Probability Distribution:**
   - Plot the distribution of predicted probabilities for diabetes occurrence, providing insights into the model's confidence levels.

3. **Classification Results Visualization:**
   - Create a confusion matrix or ROC curve to illustrate the classification performance for disease and non-disease instances.

## 8. Documentation:
- Establish a GitHub repository with a focus on ensemble learning for the Diabetes Classification Dataset.
- Create a README file detailing the purpose, the dataset used, instructions for replicating the ensemble analysis, and information on the selected best model. Include information on diabetes type prediction and how it contributes to the overall analysis.
