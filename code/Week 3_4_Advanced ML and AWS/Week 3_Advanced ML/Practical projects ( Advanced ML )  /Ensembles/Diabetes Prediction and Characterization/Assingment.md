# Ensemble Learning Focus Assignment: "Heart Disease Prediction and Characterization with UCI Heart Disease Dataset"

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive analysis of the UCI Heart Disease Dataset using ensemble learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking. The assignment aims to predict and characterize heart disease, including the inclusion of disease types.

## 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Load the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and conduct an initial exploration.
- Address missing values, outliers, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Utilize EDA visualizations to gain insights into key features.

## 2. Feature Engineering:
- Select relevant features based on the dataset analysis.
- Explore feature importance and consider creating new features to enhance ensemble model performance.
- **Add a new column: Disease_Type**
  - Based on domain knowledge, create a new column that categorizes the type of heart disease when the diagnosis is positive. Consider categorizing into types such as Angina, Myocardial Infarction, or other relevant categories.

## 3. Ensemble Model Implementation:
- Implement ensemble models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train and tune each ensemble model using appropriate hyperparameter tuning.

## 4. Model Evaluation and Comparison:
- Evaluate ensemble models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize and compare feature importance across ensemble models.
- Analyze and compare the strengths and weaknesses of each ensemble technique.

## 5. Best Model Selection:
- Identify the best-performing ensemble model based on evaluation metrics.
- Provide reasoning for selecting the chosen model.

## 6. Data Visualization Techniques:
- Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing feature importance, model performance, and ensemble technique comparisons.

## 7. Characterization, Prediction, and Classification:
- Characterize heart disease by identifying key features contributing to the condition.
- Predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence using the best-performing ensemble model.
- Classify instances into disease and non-disease categories.
- **Extend the classification:** Predict and visualize different heart disease types.

### Data Visualizations:
1. **Feature Importance Plot:**
   - Visualize the importance of features in predicting heart disease using a bar chart.

2. **Prediction Probability Distribution:**
   - Plot the distribution of predicted probabilities for heart disease occurrence, providing insights into the model's confidence levels.

3. **Classification Results Visualization:**
   - Create a confusion matrix or ROC curve to illustrate the classification performance for disease and non-disease instances.

## 8. Documentation:
- Establish a GitHub repository with a focus on ensemble learning for the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.
- Create a README file detailing the purpose, the dataset used, instructions for replicating the ensemble analysis, and information on the selected best model.
